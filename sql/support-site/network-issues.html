    <h1>Network Issues and Solutions</h1>  
  
    <h2>Issue: Slow Internet Connection</h2>  
    <p>Solution: First, try rebooting your modem and router by unplugging them, waiting for about 30 seconds, and plugging them back in. If the issue persists, check to ensure no other devices are using excessive bandwidth. You can also run a speed test to see if you're getting the speeds you're paying for. Contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if the problem continues.</p>  
  
    <h2>Issue: No Internet Connection</h2>  
    <p>Solution: Start by checking if all cables are securely connected. Reboot your modem and router by unplugging them for 30 seconds and then plugging them back in. Make sure your Wi-Fi is turned on and you're connected to the correct network. If you're still having issues, contact your ISP for further assistance.</p>  
  
    <h2>Issue: Frequent Disconnects</h2>  
    <p>Solution: Ensure your router firmware is up-to-date by visiting the manufacturer's website and following their update instructions. Try changing the Wi-Fi channel on your router settings to reduce interference. Place your router in a central location to improve signal strength. If you continue to experience disconnects, consider upgrading to a more robust router.</p>  
  
    <h2>Issue: Weak Wi-Fi Signal</h2>  
    <p>Solution: Relocate your router to a central location in your home to maximize coverage. Remove any physical obstructions like walls or large furniture that might be blocking the signal. Consider using a Wi-Fi extender to boost the signal in areas with weak reception. Updating your router's firmware can also help improve signal strength.</p>  
  
    <h2>Issue: Unable to Connect to Wi-Fi</h2>  
    <p>Solution: Double-check that you are entering the correct Wi-Fi password. Restart your device and try reconnecting. Forget the network on your device and reconnect to it by selecting it from the list of available networks and entering the password again. If the problem persists, reboot your modem and router.</p>  
  
    <h2>Issue: IP Address Conflict</h2>  
    <p>Solution: Restart your router to assign new IP addresses to your devices. On your device, you can release and renew the IP address by opening Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) and typing "ipconfig /release" followed by "ipconfig /renew." Ensure that your router's DHCP settings are enabled. If the issue continues, consider setting static IP addresses for your devices.</p>  
  
    <h2>Issue: DNS Server Not Responding</h2>  
    <p>Solution: Restart your modem and router. On your device, you can change the DNS server settings to use Googleâ€™s DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or OpenDNS (208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220). To do this on Windows, go to Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings > Right-click on your network > Properties > Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Properties. Enter the preferred and alternate DNS server addresses and save the changes.</p>  
  
    <h2>Issue: Limited Connectivity</h2>  
    <p>Solution: Reboot your modem and router to refresh your network connection. Ensure that your device is within range of the Wi-Fi signal. On your device, forget the network and reconnect to it. If you're using a public Wi-Fi network, you may need to open a web browser and log in or accept terms and conditions to gain full access.</p>  
  
    <h2>Issue: Network Adapter Issues</h2>  
    <p>Solution: Check if your network adapter is enabled by going to Device Manager (Windows) or System Preferences > Network (Mac). If it's disabled, enable it. Update the network adapter drivers by visiting the manufacturer's website and downloading the latest version. If updating the drivers doesn't work, try uninstalling the network adapter from Device Manager and then restarting your computer to allow it to reinstall automatically.</p>  
  
    <h2>Issue: Router Not Broadcasting SSID</h2>  
    <p>Solution: Access your router's settings by entering its IP address into a web browser. Log in using the admin credentials. Navigate to the wireless settings section and ensure that SSID broadcast is enabled. Save the settings and reboot your router. If the SSID still doesn't appear, reset your router to factory settings and reconfigure it from scratch.</p>
